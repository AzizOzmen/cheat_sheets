## Discovering AWS
You might realise that it’s probably near impossible to dive into 
each service and completely understand how they work and most likely,
you don’t really need to know the exact ins and outs. But, having a basic 
understanding on each service can be a major benefit as a developer, architect 
or administrator. It makes it easier to see if there is an already existing solution
for your problem at hand.

So, I dove into each and every service to figure out what it
exactly was for and how it works in the basics. I tried to
experiment with as many components as possible (time and
money permitting, I didn’t want to spend 15.000$ on 
AWS Data Exchange). I tried to capture what the 
service does in a single one-liner to give 
you a global overview.

I think most of them are correct enough but if you have any suggestions 
or corrections, please tell me!
